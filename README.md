# Introduction #

This repository contains ALL, the TASKS and the PROJECTS in the training program from the [french school of programming `Ecole 42`](https://www.42.fr/).

Projects and assignments will allow you to independently develop your programming skills, and the practical experience and knowledge gained while completing assignments and projects of School 42 will give you the necessary basis for professional integration, helping you to get a demanded profession from scratch.

By sequentially moving through the directions, languages ​​and educational projects of School 42, using [the `Holy Graph` projects map](./01_Projects__(Main_Cource)/Holy_Graph.png), you will develop fundamental technical skills:

- System programming skills.
- Knowing and understanding the essence of operating systems, networks, clouds and the services they contain.
- Systems and network administration skills.
- Information security skills.
- AI skills.
- Mobile Dev skills.
- Graphics skills.
- WEB development skills.
- Network skills.
- DB and Data.
- etc.

School 42's curriculum is individualized. Here, everyone progresses on their own, at their own pace, and not in accordance with the entire class of students (where the latest element slows down the work of the entire group), thus gaining their own understanding of programming paradigms.



# 1. SCHOOL DOCUMENTATION #

Here you can familiarize yourself with the rules in force within the walls of School 42, learn about the curriculum itself, read about the standards by which you will need to write code when solving tasks and projects, and also see everything that will help you start learning programming according to the program Schools 42.

# 2. PISCINE C #

It is from this place that the teaching of programming in School 42 will begin.

- `Piscine` by language `C`: [[ en ]](./00_Piscine_C)
- Exam tasks of the `Piscine` by language `C`: [[ en ][ fr ][ ru ]](./00_Piscine_C/Exam_C)

Here you will be fully immersed in the deep part of the code, which will allow you to truly discover the school, its unique teaching method and, above all, what programming really is.

Every day of the pool you will receive a portion of tasks (usually 10 - 25), arranged in increasing difficulty. And every day you will go through a new topic and new features of the language that you will understand and remember while completing the tasks of this day.

To help you understand them, you are provided with training videos for 10-30 minutes with theory and examples (use the function of subtitles in the player and their translation into the language you need), but as a rule, this will never be enough. Therefore, you are looking for all the necessary information for training yourself via the Internet.

From day one, you are confronted not only with difficult tasks, but with entire areas of knowledge that you may not even know exist. Thus, no matter how high your entry level is, you are bound to run into a problem that is bound to cause difficulty. Seeing him, you will first fall into a stupor, but then with incredible efforts, having made a number of mistakes, you will still cope with the task and acquire a skill that will become a familiar tool. "Piscine" in "C" language will be a test of endurance for those who decide to start the programming path in order to determine the most motivated.

Remember that learning the C programming language is fundamental to learning all other programming languages ​​like C ++, Java, Python, etc. Because all other advanced programming languages ​​have only been derived from the concepts of the C language.


# 3. MAIN TRAINING #

[Core Learning Projects](./01_Projects__(Main_Cource)/)  represent the next step in programming learning. All of them are grouped by directions, which are represented as branches. Remember that each subsequent project of your chosen branch is more difficult than the previous one and can only be solved using the skills acquired in previous projects.

Use [ the `Holy Graph` project map ](./01_Projects__(Main_Cource)/Holy_Graph.png) and [ the visual` highlighting_branches` ](./01_Projects__(Main_Cource)/highlighting_branches_Holy_Graph.gif) direction map to progress through the school 42 mainstream assignments/projects.
